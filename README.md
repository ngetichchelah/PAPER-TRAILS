https://kenya-kcse-trails.lovable.app/about

**Project Summary**

This project, Paper Trails, investigates trends in Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examination participation across gender, age group, county, region, and year for the period 2022 to 2024.

**Problem Statement**

Having just completed my own journey through school, I have been overwhelmed with gratitude. Though typical of every gratitude moment in a human being , thoughts drifted in comparison to the students who like me made it and especially to the other side of the coin - those who never made it to the end. Whether due to inequality, systemic failures, or socioeconomic challenges, they did not get the chance to prove their educational journey. This project is a way of asking: how can we help more students make it to the finish line?

**Research Question**

How do KCSE examination participation rates vary by gender, age group, and county in Kenya, and what trends emerge over time?

**Why This Analysis Is Important**
- KCSE candidature as a proxy for educational success – Students sitting the KCSE represent those who have successfully navigated Kenya’s secondary education system.
- Regional equity analysis – County-level data reveals disparities and inequalities in access and retention.
- Gender parity insights – Identifies gender gaps and geographical variance in female vs male completion rates.
- Age pattern analysis – Over-age candidature often reveals issues like delayed school entry, repetition, or dropout-reentry cycles.
- Policy relevance – This analysis supports evidence-based education planning and resource allocation.

**Key Questions Explored**
- Which counties are underperforming in getting students to KCSE level?
- Are there regional patterns in gender disparities?
- How do age distributions vary across counties?
- What trends emerge in candidature between 2022 and 2024?
